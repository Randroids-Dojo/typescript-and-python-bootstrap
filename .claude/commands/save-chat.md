Please save our chat to a txt file

Follow these steps:

1. Get the current system timestamp
2. Create a new text file named: ./ChatHistory/<system-timestamp>.txt
3. Save all of our messages into the new text file
  3.1  Command to use: 
  cat > /path/to/ChatHistory/timestamp.txt << 'CHATEND'
  [All chat content goes here]
  CHATEND

  3.2 The 'CHATEND' appears twice - once to start the heredoc and once to end it. You need to format the bash command correctly, with all the conversation
   content between these delimiters.
4. Confirm that the full chat logs have been saved
5. Remind me to end the chat and start a new one
