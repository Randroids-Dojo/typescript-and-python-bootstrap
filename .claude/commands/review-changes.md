Please analyze all recent changes.

Follow these steps:

1. Use `git status` to get changes
2. Understand what changes were made
3. Analyze how the changes deviate from the project plan in ./README.md
4. Use `./scripts/stop.sh && ./scripts/start.sh` to confirm everything builds and runs locally
5. Confirm http://localhost:3000 loads without an error
  5.1. Check the actual HTML content with curl http://localhost:3000 (not just headers)
  5.2. Look at the container logs with docker logs typescript-and-python-bootstrap-frontend-1
  5.3. Test the actual functionality in a browser or with more comprehensive requests
6. Use `./scripts/test.sh` to run all FrontEnd, BackEnd, and Auth test suites
7. Use `./scripts/lint.sh` to ensure all FrontEnd, BackEnd, and Auth code passes style and quality checks
8. Write down your feedback as a checklist of items for the agents in `./<service-folder>/todo.txt` file for each agent
