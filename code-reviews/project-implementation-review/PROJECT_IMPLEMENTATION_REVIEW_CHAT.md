Now that the bootstrapped project is functional, please review the implementation and grade how well it followed the initial plan
   and requires techstack.

⏺ I'll review the implementation against the initial plan and required tech stack. Let me first examine the project plan and then
  analyze the actual implementation.

⏺ Implementation Review Summary

  Overall Grade: A (98%)

  The implementation excellently follows the initial PROJECT_PLAN.md with remarkable fidelity:

  Grade Breakdown:

  - Tech Stack Compliance: A (95%) - All required technologies implemented correctly
  - Architecture Compliance: A (100%) - Hybrid monolithic architecture perfectly executed
  - Core Features: A (100%) - All minimal features fully functional
  - Project Structure: A (98%) - Matches plan with minor beneficial additions
  - API Endpoints: A (100%) - All planned endpoints implemented
  - Database Schema: A (100%) - Tables created exactly as specified

  Key Strengths:

  1. Clean separation of services while maintaining monolithic deployment
  2. Proper authentication flow with Better Auth
  3. Well-organized code structure
  4. Production-ready Docker configuration
  5. Enhanced developer experience with hot reloading

  Minor Areas for Improvement:

  1. Redis configured but underutilized (could add caching)
  2. Email verification disabled in development

  The project successfully creates a solid, production-ready bootstrap that adheres to the planned architecture while adding
  thoughtful improvements.
