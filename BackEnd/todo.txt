# BackEnd ToDo List

## Critical Issues

1. Auth Service Connection Failure
   - [ ] Fix "auth_service":"degraded" status in health check
   - [ ] Ensure backend can properly connect to Auth service
   - [ ] Update BetterAuth client code to handle Auth service unavailability gracefully
   - [ ] Add retry mechanisms for Auth service connections
   - [ ] Add fallback authentication mode when Auth service is unavailable

## High Priority

1. Test Framework Issues
   - [ ] Fix TestClient initialization error in tests: TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'app'
   - [ ] Fix ModuleNotFoundError for 'better_auth' in test_auth_client_error_handling
   - [ ] Fix AssertionError in test_redis_connection (assert 'test_value' is None)
   - [ ] Update pytest configuration to properly handle async tests

2. Environment Configuration
   - [ ] Fix error running linting: cannot import name 'main' from 'ruff.__main__'
   - [ ] Update Python dependencies in requirements.txt to ensure compatibility
   - [ ] Fix test environment configuration for Redis connection

3. BetterAuth Integration
   - [ ] Ensure the proper better-auth client library is installed and configured
   - [ ] Update mock configurations for BetterAuth client in tests
   - [ ] Add proper error handling for all Auth service interactions

## Medium Priority

1. Code Quality Improvements
   - [ ] Fix remaining linting warnings and errors
   - [ ] Add more comprehensive test coverage for auth middleware
   - [ ] Update API documentation to reflect current endpoints

2. Docker Environment
   - [ ] Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed in the Docker container
   - [ ] Fix communication between services in Docker Compose setup

## Low Priority

1. Performance Improvements
   - [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed resources
   - [ ] Optimize database queries for performance
   - [ ] Implement background tasks for non-critical operations
