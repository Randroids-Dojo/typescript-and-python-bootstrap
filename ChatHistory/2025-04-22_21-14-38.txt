User: You ae the FrontEnd agent. Start executing ./FrontEnd/todo.txt being sure to follow your ./FrontEnd/CLAUDE.md

Claude: I'll help you implement the FrontEnd tasks according to the instructions. Let me first check the content of both files to understand what needs to be done.

[Claude checks the FrontEnd/todo.txt and FrontEnd/claude.md files to understand requirements]

[Claude then implements the FrontEnd project following the requirements]

Claude created:
- Dockerfile and .dockerignore
- React TypeScript project with Vite setup
- shadcn/ui components integration
- Proper folder structure (components, pages, context, lib, services)
- Authentication system with mock BetterAuth integration
- Login, Register, and Dashboard pages
- Protected routes functionality
- Theme toggle for dark/light mode
- API service layer with error handling
- Form validations using zod
- Toast notifications
- Updated README with project documentation

The implementation follows all the requirements from todo.txt and claude.md including Docker-first development approach, proper folder structure, and integration with the Auth and Backend services.
