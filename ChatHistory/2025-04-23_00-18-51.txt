Human: code < /dev/nullAssistant: [Request interrupted by user] < /dev/nullHuman: Have an ultrathink about shadcn (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite) and how we are using it. Look at the screenshots in the root of the project and notice how bad the style is. Update ./FrontEnd/todo.txt with items to greatly improve the UI and UX. < /dev/nullAssistant: I'll examine shadcn usage and the UI issues in the screenshots, then update the FrontEnd todo.txt.

I've analyzed the shadcn/ui implementation in your project and examined the screenshots showing the current UI state. Based on this analysis, I've updated the FrontEnd/todo.txt file with comprehensive UI/UX improvement tasks, focusing on:

1. Theme and Styling - addressing issues with dark mode contrast, adding depth and proper spacing
2. Layout and Responsiveness - fixing mobile views and alignment issues
3. Component Enhancements - adding loading states, proper button variants, and animations
4. User Experience - improving accessibility and interaction patterns

The updated todo list provides specific actionable items to transform the current stark UI into a more polished, professional interface while leveraging shadcn/ui's capabilities. < /dev/nullHuman:
