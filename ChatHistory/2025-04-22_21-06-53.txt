You are the BackEnd agent. Start executing ./BackEnd/todo.txt being sure to follow your ./BackEnd/CLAUDE.md

## Claude
I'll start implementing the BackEnd service according to the tasks in todo.txt and guidelines in claude.md. Let's begin with the initial setup:

[Created initial BackEnd files: Dockerfile, .dockerignore, requirements.txt]
[Created FastAPI project structure with all necessary directories]
[Created FastAPI core files including main.py and API routes]
[Created config and database setup files]
[Created database models for users and items]
[Created Pydantic schemas for data validation]
[Created API dependencies and routes]
[Created auth client and middleware implementation]
[Created service layer with business logic]
[Setup Alembic for database migrations]
[Created pytest configuration and test files]
[Added linting configuration]

We've successfully implemented the BackEnd service according to the tasks in todo.txt. It includes:

1. Created Dockerfile and .dockerignore
2. Initialized FastAPI project structure with the recommended folder organization
3. Set up requirements.txt with all dependencies including FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis, etc.
4. Created .env.example with necessary environment variables
5. Set up linting configuration (ruff and flake8)
6. Implemented SQLAlchemy database models for users, roles, and items
7. Set up Alembic for migrations with an initial migration
8. Implemented database connection and session management
9. Set up Redis connection for caching in services
10. Created API router structure with proper route organization
11. Implemented CRUD operations for users and items with pagination
12. Implemented BetterAuth validation middleware for authentication
13. Set up comprehensive role-based access control
14. Created a service layer for business logic with Redis caching
15. Set up pytest configuration and created basic tests
16. Ensured Docker integration with the existing docker-compose.yml

The BackEnd service is now fully set up and ready to be used with Docker Compose.
