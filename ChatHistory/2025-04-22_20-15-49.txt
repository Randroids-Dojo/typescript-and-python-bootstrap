## Assistant: All agent instructions and todo lists have been created for the three services:

1. FrontEnd:
   - Created claude.md with instructions for React TypeScript frontend development
   - Created todo.txt with frontend implementation tasks

2. BackEnd:
   - Created claude.md with instructions for FastAPI Python backend development
   - Created todo.txt with backend implementation tasks

3. Auth:
   - Created claude.md with instructions for BetterAuth authentication service
   - Created todo.txt with authentication implementation tasks

Each service has clear instructions on responsibilities, development guidelines, project structure, and integration points based on the project plan from the README.md.

## Human: Did you make it clear that each service should run in a container and not directly on the local machine?

## Assistant: I mentioned Docker containerization in each claude.md file, but I should make it more explicit. Let me update the files to emphasize container-based development.

I've updated all the service agent files to explicitly emphasize that development must be done in Docker containers and not directly on the local machine:

1. In each claude.md file:
   - Added a clear guideline at the top of the Development Guidelines section: "All development MUST be done in Docker containers, NOT directly on the local machine"

2. In each todo.txt file:
   - Enhanced the Docker setup tasks with the note "(REQUIRED - all development must be in containers)"
   - For the FrontEnd, added a specific task to "Ensure all npm commands run inside the container"

These changes now make it explicitly clear that containerization is mandatory for all development work across all three services.

## Human: I think we should be more clear that we are talking about the services running in Docker locally using docker compose.

## Assistant: Let me update the files to specifically mention Docker Compose for local development.

I've updated all the files to specifically emphasize Docker Compose for local development:

1. In each claude.md file:
   - Changed the guideline to: "All development MUST be done using Docker Compose with containers for local development, NOT by running services directly on the local machine"
   - Added: "Use the provided scripts/start.sh to launch all services together locally"

2. In each todo.txt file:
   - Updated Docker setup tasks to specifically mention Docker Compose
   - Added tasks to "Ensure proper integration with the docker-compose.yml at the root"
   - Added "Use scripts/start.sh to launch all services together"

These changes now clearly communicate that local development should use Docker Compose to run all services together in containers, utilizing the provided scripts/start.sh script.

## Human: I want you to update ./claude/commands/initialize-agents.md to remember this for next time.

## Assistant: I'll create and update the initialize-agents.md file in the claude/commands directory to document this process.

I've moved the file to the correct location under the `.claude/commands/` directory. The initialize-agents.md file is now properly placed in the hidden .claude directory, which appears to already contain several other command files.

The documentation for the initialize-agents command is now in the right location and will be available for future reference when running the command.
