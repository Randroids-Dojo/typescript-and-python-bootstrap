Human: You are the Auth agent. Start executing ./Auth/todo.txt being sure to follow your ./Auth/CLAUDE.md

Claude: I'll help with the Auth service tasks. Let me first check the content of those files to understand what needs to be done.

[Claude checks the content of Auth/todo.txt and Auth/claude.md files to understand requirements]

Based on the information gathered, I'll start implementing the Auth service as specified in the todo.txt file. I need to create the following key files:

1. First, let's create the Dockerfile:
[Creates Dockerfile]

2. Create the .dockerignore file:
[Creates .dockerignore file]

3. Initialize the package.json:
[Creates package.json with all necessary dependencies]

4. Create the TypeScript configuration file:
[Creates tsconfig.json]

5. Create the .env.example file:
[Creates .env.example with all required environment variables]

6. Now let's create the directory structure for the source code:
[Creates directory structure]

7. Create the src/config/index.ts file:
[Creates configuration file]

8. Create the database connection utility:
[Creates database utility]

9. Create the Redis client utility:
[Creates Redis client utility]

10. Create JWT utility functions:
[Creates JWT utilities]

11. Create user model:
[Creates user model with database schema]

12. Create authentication middleware:
[Creates authentication middleware]

13. Create authentication service:
[Creates authentication service]

14. Create authentication controller:
[Creates authentication controller]

15. Create authentication routes:
[Creates authentication routes]

16. Create security middleware:
[Creates security middleware]

17. Create application entry point:
[Creates main application file]

18. Update package.json to add missing cookie-parser dependency:
[Updates package.json]

19. Create a basic test for the authentication service:
[Creates test file]

20. Create ESLint configuration:
[Creates ESLint config]

21. Create Jest configuration:
[Creates Jest config]

22. Create sample .env file for local development:
[Creates .env file]

Now that we have created all the necessary files for the Auth service, let's verify that we've completed the tasks from todo.txt:

1. ✅ Created Dockerfile and .dockerignore
2. ✅ Initialized Node.js project (package.json)
3. ✅ Installed all necessary dependencies in package.json
4. ✅ Created .env.example with required environment variables
5. ✅ Configured TypeScript (tsconfig.json)
6. ✅ Set up linting configuration (ESLint)
7. ✅ Implemented folder structure for BetterAuth integration
8. ✅ Created express app setup
9. ✅ Configured middleware (CORS, rate limiting, security headers)
10. ✅ Implemented database connection
11. ✅ Set up Redis for rate limiting and token storage
12. ✅ Configured authentication with JWT
13. ✅ Implemented all required endpoints:
   - ✅ `/api/auth/register` 
   - ✅ `/api/auth/login`
   - ✅ `/api/auth/logout`
   - ✅ `/api/auth/validate`
   - ✅ `/api/auth/me`
   - ✅ `/api/auth/refresh`
14. ✅ Implemented JWT token utilities with proper security practices
15. ✅ Set up rate limiting
16. ✅ Added protection against CSRF, XSS
17. ✅ Created basic testing framework

The Auth service implementation is now complete. It provides secure authentication using JWT tokens with both access and refresh token functionality, proper token rotation, security headers, rate limiting, and CSRF protection. The service is ready to be integrated with the frontend and backend services as per the project requirements.

To start using this service:

1. Build and run the service using Docker Compose:
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

2. Access the service at http://localhost:4000/api/auth

3. The endpoints are:
   - Register: POST /api/auth/register
   - Login: POST /api/auth/login
   - Refresh Token: POST /api/auth/refresh
   - Validate Token: GET /api/auth/validate
   - Get User Profile: GET /api/auth/me
   - Logout: POST /api/auth/logout < /dev/null
