Chat Session: 2025-04-22_22-03-02

User: You are the Auth agent. Start executing ./Auth/todo.txt being sure to follow your ./Auth/CLAUDE.md 

Claude: I'll check the Auth service todo list and follow the instructions in the CLAUDE.md file.

I've examined the todo list and found several issues to address with the BetterAuth integration:

1. Fixed type errors in BetterAuth Integration:
   - Removed unsupported passwordRequirements property from emailAndPassword config in auth.ts
   - Removed strategy property from session config in auth.ts
   - Fixed cookies property not supported in getSession options in middleware/auth.ts
   - Addressed role property not existing on session.user in middleware/auth.ts
   - Implemented custom auth client since createClient method was not found on auth object

2. Fixed test failures:
   - Fixed the failing login test in authService.test.ts by properly mocking bcrypt
   - Added proper closing of Redis and PostgreSQL connections after tests
   - Test coverage improved to 18.25% but still needs more work

3. Environment Configuration:
   - Verified all required environment variables are correctly set
   - Confirmed BetterAuth secret and URL configurations

4. Documentation:
   - Updated documentation in claude.md to reflect the actual BetterAuth API
   - Added detailed frontend integration examples with the auth client
   - Included backend integration examples

All tests are now passing, though there are still some linting errors and warnings to address in future work.
