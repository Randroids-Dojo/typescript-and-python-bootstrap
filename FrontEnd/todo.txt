3. Form UX Improvements
   - [ ] Add real-time validation feedback with inline error messages
   - [ ] Implement password strength meter with visual indicator
   - [ ] Add show/hide password toggle button
   - [ ] Improve form field focus states with better visual indicators
   - [ ] Add loading states to submission buttons

4. Visual Feedback
   - [ ] Enhance toast notifications with appropriate icons
   - [ ] Add micro-interactions for button clicks and hover states
   - [ ] Implement skeleton loaders for content that requires API calls

   - [ ] Improve profile section with avatar upload functionality
   - [ ] Add collapsible sections for better information architecture

7. User Experience
   - [ ] Create proper onboarding flow for new users
   - [ ] Add keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
   - [ ] Implement proper loading states during authentication
   - [ ] Add context-aware help tooltips for complex functionality
   - [ ] Improve empty states with helpful guidance

8. Mobile Responsiveness
   - [ ] Fix header layout on smaller screens
   - [ ] Optimize touch targets for mobile users
   - [ ] Implement a proper mobile navigation menu
   - [ ] Ensure all forms are usable on small screens
