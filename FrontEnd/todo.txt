# FrontEnd ToDo List

## Critical Issues

1. Better Auth Integration
   - [ ] Replace mock implementation in src/lib/auth.ts with real better-auth client
   - [ ] Ensure proper error handling for auth service connections
   - [ ] Configure auth client to connect to correct Auth service URL
   - [ ] Fix client retry mechanisms for intermittent Auth service issues

2. Node.js Version Compatibility
   - [ ] Address Node.js version compatibility warnings (requires Node.js >=20.0.0)
   - [ ] Update Docker image to use Node.js 20+ for proper compatibility with react-router and other dependencies
   - [ ] Ensure all npm packages are compatible with the Node.js version

## High Priority

1. Component Imports
   - [ ] Fix React fast refresh warnings in UI components
   - [ ] Organize component exports to avoid "Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components" warnings
   - [ ] Fix any import/export issues in UI components

2. Environment Configuration
   - [ ] Ensure .env files are properly configured for Auth service connection
   - [ ] Fix Docker environment variables for proper service communication
   - [ ] Verify Auth service URL is being properly picked up from environment variables

## Medium Priority

1. Testing
   - [ ] Implement proper tests for auth integration
   - [ ] Add tests for UI components
   - [ ] Set up automatic test runs in CI/CD pipeline

2. User Experience
   - [ ] Improve error messages for auth failures
   - [ ] Add loading states during auth operations
   - [ ] Implement proper form validation for auth forms
