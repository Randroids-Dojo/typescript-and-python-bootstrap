# FrontEnd ToDo List

## Critical Issues

1. Better Auth Integration
   - [x] Replace mock implementation in src/lib/auth.ts with real better-auth client
   - [x] Ensure proper error handling for auth service connections
   - [x] Configure auth client to connect to correct Auth service URL
   - [x] Fix client retry mechanisms for intermittent Auth service issues

2. Node.js Version Compatibility
   - [x] Address Node.js version compatibility warnings (requires Node.js >=20.0.0)
   - [x] Update Docker image to use Node.js 20+ for proper compatibility with react-router and other dependencies
   - [x] Ensure all npm packages are compatible with the Node.js version

## High Priority

1. Component Imports
   - [x] Fix React fast refresh warnings in UI components
   - [x] Organize component exports to avoid "Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components" warnings
   - [x] Fix any import/export issues in UI components

2. Environment Configuration
   - [x] Ensure .env files are properly configured for Auth service connection
   - [x] Fix Docker environment variables for proper service communication
   - [x] Verify Auth service URL is being properly picked up from environment variables

## UI/UX Improvements (High Priority)

1. Theme and Styling
   - [x] Fix dark mode implementation - current dark UI is too stark and has poor contrast
   - [x] Implement proper color gradient accents to replace flat black background
   - [x] Add proper spacing between UI elements (cards, form fields, buttons)
   - [x] Standardize border radius across all components for visual consistency
   - [x] Add subtle shadows and depth to cards and interactive elements
   - [x] Create a proper brand color palette with primary/secondary colors

2. Layout and Responsiveness
   - [x] Fix layout issues in mobile view - forms are too wide on small screens
   - [x] Implement proper responsive grid layout for Dashboard page
   - [ ] Add proper page transitions between routes
   - [x] Create consistent header/footer layout across all pages
   - [x] Fix alignment issues in form fields and buttons

3. Component Enhancements
   - [x] Add loading skeletons for data-dependent components
   - [x] Implement proper toast notifications with shadcn/ui toast component
   - [x] Replace basic buttons with proper button variants (primary, secondary, ghost)
   - [x] Add hover/focus states to all interactive elements
   - [x] Implement input field icons (email, password, search)
   - [x] Add animation to form submission and transitions

4. User Experience
   - [ ] Create proper onboarding flow for new users
   - [x] Add form validation feedback in real-time (not just on submit)
   - [x] Implement progress indicators for multi-step operations
   - [ ] Add keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
   - [x] Fix accessibility issues (contrast, focus states, screen reader support)

## Medium Priority

1. Testing
   - [ ] Implement proper tests for auth integration
   - [ ] Add tests for UI components
   - [ ] Set up automatic test runs in CI/CD pipeline

2. User Experience Refinements
   - [x] Improve error messages for auth failures with clear recovery steps
   - [x] Add loading states during auth operations
   - [x] Implement proper form validation for auth forms
   - [x] Create consistent error state UI across the application
   - [ ] Add guided help tooltips for complex interactions
