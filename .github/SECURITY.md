## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [your-email@example.com]
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue

## Security Update Process

1. Security patches are released as soon as possible after verification
2. Critical vulnerabilities are patched within 24-48 hours
3. Medium severity issues are addressed within 1 week
4. Low severity issues are included in regular updates

## Security Best Practices

This project follows these security best practices:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Email verification for new accounts

### Data Protection
- All passwords hashed using bcrypt
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- HTTPS enforced in production

### Infrastructure Security
- Containers run as non-root users
- Network segmentation between services
- Secrets managed via environment variables
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot

### Monitoring & Logging
- Security event logging
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Audit logs for sensitive operations
- No sensitive data in logs

## Dependency Management

- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Weekly security scans of dependencies
- Grouped updates for minor/patch versions
- Manual review for major version updates

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Development Mode**: The development configuration includes default credentials and exposed ports for ease of development. Never use development settings in production.

2. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure CORS is properly configured for your production domain before deployment.

3. **Session Management**: Sessions expire after 24 hours. Implement refresh token rotation for better UX.
